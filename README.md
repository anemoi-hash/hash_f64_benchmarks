# hash

This crate provides a minimal implementation of several algebraic cryptographic hash functions over a 64-bit prime field.

* This implementation can be used in `no-std` environments by relying on the `alloc` crate instead.

**WARNING:** This is an ongoing, prototype implementation subject to changes. In particular, it has not been audited and may contain bugs and security flaws. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.
